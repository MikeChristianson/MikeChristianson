Beyond the nuts and bolts, I have a history of fostering community and knowledge-sharing within the software engineering field.

From 2011 to 2022, I led the _Phoenix Software Engineering Reading Group_ (meetup.com group is now closed), a book club for software engineers promoting thoughtful and lively discussions about the craft and philosophy of software development. Our meetup provided a space for individuals to add their unique voice and experience. We welcomed both seasoned professionals and newcomers alike. 

During that time, I had the privilege of presenting "Your First Amazon Alexa Skill," a live demonstration of building a skill from start to finish, at [_Desert Code Camp 2016.1_](https://oct2016.desertcodecamp.com/session/1210) and, by request, at the _Phoenix Mobile & IoT Meetup_ later that same year.
